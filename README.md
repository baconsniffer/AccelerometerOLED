# AccelerometerOLED
A little exercise in accelerometer measurement

Uses the following libraries // hardware
<U8x8lib.h>                  // SSD1306 Library
<SparkFun_ADXL345.h>         // SparkFun ADXL345 Library

This was a lot of fun. Thinking of adding an SD card to log the data
and putting it in the car to ride around for a bit.
